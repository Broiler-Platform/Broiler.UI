# Broiler.UI ADR Index

These records define the core UI architecture, RichEdit family, document-model
promotion, filesystem topology, Formatting Codes view, and the controls Broiler
Code needs. ADR 0018 supersedes the model *placement* in ADRs 0013 and 0014;
their remaining design decisions still apply. Accepted and partially superseded
records are retained for traceability. Current follow-up work is in
[the component roadmap](../roadmap.md).

ADRs 0021 to 0024 were approved during Broiler Code Phase 0. They record
Broiler.UI decisions, not product decisions: the product context is in
[the Broiler Code architecture](../../../docs/architecture/broiler-code.md).
